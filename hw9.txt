my_data: 56 34 11 CD AB CD AB

Question 2:
(a)
The program computes the total of the absolute values of all non-zero elements in the array arr and places the result in [d].
Final value of [d]: 105 (calculated as |5| + |50| + |20| + |30|)
(b)
A value of 0 in the array serves as a marker to signify the end. The program stops processing further when the value in dx matches 0.
(c)
The elements in the array are 16 bits (2 bytes) in size. This can be inferred from the dw directive in the declaration and the use of mov dx, [ecx], which reads a 16-bit word.
(d)
The d variable occupies 32 bits (4 bytes), as indicated by the use of the dd directive in its definition.
(e)
The array's total size in memory is 10 bytes, with 5 elements, each taking up 2 bytes.
(f)
To find the absolute value of a number, the program checks if it is negative. If it is, the neg instruction is used to negate it by applying two's complement. If positive, the value remains unchanged.
(g)
The xor edx, edx operation sets edx to 0. This initialization clears any residual values, ensuring the program correctly identifies the end of the array when it encounters a 0.
